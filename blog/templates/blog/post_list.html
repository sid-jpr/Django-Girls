                 Post model, Django creates one for us (by default, a number that increases by one for each record, i.e. 1, 2, 3) and adds it
                 as a field named pk to each of our posts. We access the primary key by writing post.pk, the same way we access other fields
                 (title, author, etc.) in our Post object! -->
